This study explored the efficiency of many deep learning architectures for diagnosing bone fractures in X-ray images, including CNN, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet101V2. Precision, recall, F1-score, and total accuracy were used to assess each model's ability to differentiate between bones that were broken and those that weren't.
Based on the comparison analysis, the most reliable and consistent results were obtained by CNN and MobileNetV2, which achieved 98.12% and 98.73% accuracy, respectively. With their outstanding precision and recall across classes, both models showed great promise for dependable clinical use. DenseNet121 demonstrated relatively lower accuracy and recall, indicating restricted generalization to unknown data, but InceptionV3 and ResNet101V2 also demonstrated competitive performance. Overall, the findings demonstrate that CNN architectures based on deep learning can effectively and precisely identify bone fractures from X-ray pictures, eliminating the need for human interpretation and possibly enhancing diagnostic processes in healthcare settings. Among the assessed models, MobileNetV2 stands out due to its high accuracy, well-balanced performance metrics, and computational economy. By allowing the CNN to automatically learn and recognize fracture patterns from the input images, the suggested method does away with the need for manual feature extraction. Patients and medical professionals can get immediate diagnostic feedback thanks to the Flask integration's user-friendly, platform-independent, and readily deployable web interface. Results from experiments show that, despite differences in bone structure and image quality, the CNN model  and MobileNetV2 detects fractures with high accuracy and dependability. The system can help reduce diagnostic delays by offering fast, automated results, particularly in areas with limited resources or remote locations.To improve model transparency and clinical credibility, future research can concentrate on growing the dataset, utilizing sophisticated data augmentation techniques, and including explainable AI technologies.
